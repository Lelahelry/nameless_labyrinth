		|   Labyrinth Python Implementation   |
		|_____________________________________|


--> Description

The labyrinth is a well-known family board game. 
The players impersonate adventurers who are on a quest to collect the treasures hidden in the moving labyrinth. 
We challenged ourselves to create a digital version of this game.


--> Requirements 

- Use Python 3.10 or any newer version.*
- Python libraries : PIL, tkinter, customtkinter
- Screen resolution must be 1920x1080 so that the visuals match well.
- Keep the windows at the size they are created, and don't try to shrink or expand them.


--> Start game

- Open main.py and run the code.
- Rules are available in the top left corner.

*Please note that because of the python version installed on the INSA virtual desktops (3.8 on the 19.05.2023), 
we couldn't test our code that needs to be run under Python 3.10 minimum. 
Indeed, the pattern matching functions used aren't available for earlier verisons of python.
Hence we couldn't test that our code works well under Linux.
